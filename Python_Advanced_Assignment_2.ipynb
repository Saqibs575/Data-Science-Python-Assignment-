        "Q1. What is the relationship between classes and modules?<BR>**ANS :** A class can have its own instance, but a module cannot be instantiated. We use the ‘class’ keyword followed by class name to define a class, whereas to use modules, we use the ‘import’ keyword followed by module name.<BR>For example we can import math modeule and can use all the functions of the module. similarly We can define any class and can write the some methods inside it and can use all the methods.<BR>Classes can be defined by a user , whereas modules ar already defined packages. Like pandas, Numpy etc<BR> We can inherit a particular class and modify it using inheritance. But while using modules, it is simply a code containing variables, functions, and classes.\n",

The class statement creates a new class definition. The name of the class immediately follows the keyword class followed by a colon."

These are defined at the top of the class body."

It also used while we need to use methods inside the class itself. In the init methoed as well self is default parameter which is to passed."

        "Q6. How does a Python class handle operator overloading?<BR>**ANS :** Python operators work for built-in classes. But the same operator behaves differently with different types. For example, the + operator will perform arithmetic addition on two numbers, merge two lists, or concatenate two strings.<BR>This feature in Python that allows the same operator to have different meaning according to the context is called operator overloading.<BR>Class functions that begin with double underscore __ are called special functions in Python.\n",

When do you consider allowing operator overloading of your classes?<BR>**ANS :** If we want to concatenate the two string of the class outside the class or we want to add two integers of the class outside the class definition, so in both of these cases we require to use operator overloadining. Since , in both of these cases we have to use + operator in general. But in the case of class we can use __add__() method to achieve our goal."
