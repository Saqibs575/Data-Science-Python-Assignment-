In what contexts do the two operator overloading methods manage printing?<BR>**ANS :** ```__str__``` and ```__repr__``` are both constructors in pthon i.e both method will execute as soon as object is created. As after creating object if we call print function for the object then the address of the object will be printed. To avoid this , we can use ```__str__``` and ```__repr__```.\n",
